# Viral-Art
Becoming a popular artist is a hard and seemingly arbitrary task. But what if we could break down the most popular pieces and see what kind of artwork gets most noticed? That is what we aim to do in this project. With a combination of computer vision and machine learning, we would like identify what properties are indicative of a successful work of art.

Final project for CS231A.
