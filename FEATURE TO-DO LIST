===================
FEATURES TO-DO
==================

Color palettes:
	* need to first do kmeans, then bin the palette into 20 evenly distributed colors or something. Otherwise the numbers are meaningless...

Absolute contrast:
	* IMPLEMENTED, but useless
	* NEEDS lo-pass filter
	* lo-pass smooths out noise
	* do we need this?

===================
IMPLEMENTED, NEEDS DISCUSSION FEATURES
===================

Most Common HSV values (IMPLEMENTED):
	* Do we keep this?

Roughness (IMPLEMENTED):
	* add a hi-pass filter? boosts noise so it's easier for us to pick out graininess
